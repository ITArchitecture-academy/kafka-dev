############## Task 1: Join Wind Turbine Data with Master data
# We want to enrich the data of the wind turbines with the master data we have imported in a previous lab from the database.
# Faust does not provide joining functionality out of the box. But we can implement it ourself using the approach
# that Kafka Streams is using. We assume that the masterdata is relatively static and thus, we put it in a Faust-Table.
# Whenever new masterdata arrives, we update the table but we do not perform a join on that data.
# Whenever a new wind turbine data arrives we look the Key up in the Table and if it is found, we process both data points
# and thus, we have a Stream-Table join.
#
# Hint: The masterdata-wind_parks topic contains messages of the form {"id": "0", "name": "Name of Windpark 0"}
#
# We need two agents:
# 1. `fill_table`-Agent: It takes the data from the masterdata topic and updates the table using that data
# 2. `join_*`-Agent: It takes the data from the topic that should be enriched and looks it up in the table and performs the required operation

# todo Init the topic masterdata-wind_parks with the WindParkMasterData type. We will use it as a source to fill the table
# To produce a message for debugging purposes you can use the following command:
# echo '{"id": "0", "name": "Name of Windpark 0"}' | kcat -b localhost:9092 -t masterdata-wind_parks -k0

# todo Agent 1: write an agent that updates the table with the data from the wind_park_masterdata_topic
