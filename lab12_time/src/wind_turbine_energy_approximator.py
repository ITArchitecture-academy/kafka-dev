################ Task: Approximate generated energy
# Our wind turbines provide only the current power. But they are billed by Wh (watt-hour).
# Thus, we need to approximate the energy generated somehow.
# For this, we calculate the average energy generated in 10s-intervals.
#
# This is done using windowed tables in Faust. They are like normal tables, but hold for each window the relevant data.
# When the window closes we take the data in the window, calculate the energy and output it to a topic for further processing

# todo Init the app
app = None

# By default, Faust checks the table windows every 30s. But we do not want to wait so long.
# Reduce it to 1 second
app.conf.table_cleanup_interval = 1

# todo (preferably as one of the last things you do here)
# the table (defined below) consists of Keys of the Form (KEY, (window_start_timestamp, window_end_timestamp))
# The values are the SlidingAverages used in previous labs
def window_processor(key, sliding_average: SlidingAverage):

    # calculate the energy (the unit is what*hours – so if we have a 10s interval,
    # we need to divide it by 360 because an hour has 3600 seconds)
    energy = mean / 360

    # todo: optional: Write it also out to a topic
    # print it
